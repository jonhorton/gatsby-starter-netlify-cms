### Who We Are
My Well Ministry is a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization, registered in the state of Illinois
that provides at cost credit card processing services to faith based nonprofits. We help
organizations free up money previously spent on credit card processing fees so that it
can be reinvested to further their mission.

We were birthed out of TransNational Payments, our payment processing partner,
when the CEO John Pitzaferro, heard Bill Hybels tell the story of a man who owned a
well drilling business and felt compelled to use the success of his well drilling business
to begin drilling wells in Africa for free.

This story profoundly impacted John, and in that moment he had the realization:
"My Well is payment processing." In 2009, John officially launched My Well Ministry.

### Single origin
Single-origin coffee is coffee grown within a single known geographic origin. Sometimes, this is a single farm or a specific collection of beans from a single country. The name of the coffee is then usually the place it was grown to whatever degree available.

### Sustainable farming
Sustainable agriculture is farming in sustainable ways based on an understanding of ecosystem services, the study of relationships between organisms and their environment. What grows where and how it is grown are a matter of choice and careful consideration for nature and communities.

### Direct sourcing
Direct trade is a form of sourcing practiced by some coffee roasters. Advocates of direct trade practices promote direct communication and price negotiation between buyer and farmer, along with systems that encourage and incentivize quality.

### Reinvest profits
We want to truly empower the communities that bring amazing coffee to you. Thatâ€™s why we reinvest 20% of our profits into farms, local businesses and schools everywhere our coffee is grown. You can see the communities grow and learn more about coffee farming on our blog.
