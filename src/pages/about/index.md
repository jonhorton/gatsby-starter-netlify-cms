### Who We Are
My Well Ministry is a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization, registered in the state of Illinois
that provides at cost credit card processing services to faith based nonprofits. We help
organizations free up money previously spent on credit card processing fees so that it
can be reinvested to further their mission.

We were birthed out of TransNational Payments, our payment processing partner,
when the CEO John Pitzaferro, heard Bill Hybels tell the story of a man who owned a
well drilling business and felt compelled to use the success of his well drilling business
to begin drilling wells in Africa for free.

This story profoundly impacted John, and in that moment he had the realization:
**"My Well is payment processing."** In 2009, John officially launched My Well Ministry.
